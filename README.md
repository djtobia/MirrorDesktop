# MirrorDesktop
A program that turns your desktop into a mirror, using your webcam!

I built a small desktop app using the library found here: https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture
It uses a simple Java Swing UI to start and stop the application. Can be exported as a jar as well, but functionality is a little more difficult.


To use an exported jar, you must copy the camera-icon.png image from the git repository, and paste it in the same directory as the jar itself. Then when you run the jar, things will work.
